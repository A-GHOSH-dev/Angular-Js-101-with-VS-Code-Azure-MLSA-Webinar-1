> ### Guidelines for raising a pull request:
>
> - Each pull request should have an appropriate and short title like "Fixed Bug in Experience Page"
>
> - In case of multiple commits, please perform a rebase and make a squash commit before giving the pull request.
>
> - Pull Requests without a description would often not be reviewed. Make sure you describe your intended changes in the description section of the pull request. (Use bullet points and phrases)
>
> - Make sure to refer the respective issue in the respective PR using phrases like `Resolves #issue_number` or `Closes #issue_number`.  Here's an example to raise a PR:
